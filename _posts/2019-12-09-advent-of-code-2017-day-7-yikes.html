<div id="postText">I planned to blog about the solution after getting help from another Advent of Coder. She's tagged in the tweet below. However, I spent all day Saturday until a few minutes before Sunday, the 8th swatting bug including elementary stuff like reinitialization of objects in loops after the feedback was implemented. Thankfully that wasn't dependent on <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/7">day 7</a>.
