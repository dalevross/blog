**J**aden, we really wish you were still here

**A**dding to the joy your mom and I always share

**D**ays passed slowly while we awaited your arrival

**E**nduring the risks associated with your survival

**N**ow we'll only have lingering thoughts of you son.
<br/><br/>

**C**herishing the idea of seeing your first run.

**H**earing the first words being uttered by your lips.

**R**eading your first book, following your mom's tips

**I**deas swirl about who you'd turn out to be.

**S**hakepearian fanatic or a math "whiz" like me.

**T**o be or not to be might have become your query.

**I**'d just have wished your choice would leave you merry.

**A**dieu we are here to bid you on this day.

**N**ever forgetting that God sent you our way

<br/><br/>

**R**est assured you'll always be in our hearts.

**O**h son, it's hard when one you love departs.

**S**miles, I think, is what you'll eventually leave.

**S**trands of hope you revived and now we believe.
