**D**iscipline is all I need to get where I need to be.

**A**fter all these ups and downs this I can clearly see.

**L**ife's blessings are mine to have this I surely know.

**E**levation I declare, It's time to get into the flow.

<br/><br/>

**V**ery ready am I now to transform into my best.

**I** can beat any upcoming foe, I can face any test.

**V**ictory is coming surely, In His Word I trust.

**I**f I am to win this day, this mode to take I must.

**A** winner I am meant to be and that is who I am.

**N**ow I'll see this challenge like an olden day exam.

<br/><br/>

**R**ight now the road looks rocky, the end is unknown.

**O**f course that will not stop me, this chance won't be blown.

**S**uddenly is how it'll happen, the gift shall flower soon.

**S**uccess is surely coming, that is now my daily tune.
