A few days ago I decided to redo my resume. I decided to head over to hacker news to see if I could find a cool hacker way to get it done. As my wife “[The Irie Happy Vegan](http://www.dajeneats.com "Irie Happy Vegan")” would say, I needed to find a bulldozer to kill this fly. I saw a post that I had come across before about [jsonresume](https://jsonresume.org/).  I decided to take it for a spin and thought it was pretty neat.

Well, here is the JSON repo: https://github.com/dalevross/jsonresume  
Elegant theme: [http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross](http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross)  
Other themes [Paper](http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=paper), [Kendall](http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=kendall), [Flat](http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=flat), [Modern](http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=modern), [Classy](http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=classy), [Class](http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=class), [Short](http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=short), [Slick](http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=slick), [Kwan](http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=kwan)

I decided to play around with Camtasia a little bit and figured this was a great thing to talk about and a good time to talk about it.

So, here is my quick and fairly clean review of jsonresume.
