I lost a few things when life to a turn for the weird. I won't use the term worse, as I learned that all the difficulties I've experienced in life have taught me a lesson. I had migrated from blogger and had set up a WordPress installation on Azure. Eventually, the cost became prohibitive and I could no longer access the site. A wise man would have done a back-up but, alas. So where are we now?<br /><br />I took down one entry from here where I'd made a commitment in 2015 that I, unfortunately, didn't follow through on. Such is life. I made mistakes, but that does not mean I am done, especially at the tender age of 35. I will continue blogging from here since I already have some content here. I know there's&nbsp;<a href="http://medium.com/" target="_blank">medium.com</a> or <a href="http://dev.to/">dev.to</a> or even my <a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub pages</a> website, <a href="http://dalevross.github.io/">dalevross.github.io</a><br /><br />I am determined to return to the field I'm sure I still love, despite an overwhelming feeling of being an imposter taking over for the last few years. Those who truly know me will wonder how I could make such a claim. I was good at what I did, though far below what I know I'm capable of. Therefore, I've made a new commitment and began a fresh start.<br /><br />This is Day 6 of my <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" target="_blank">100 days of code</a> commitment and at present, I'm setting up PHP locally. I've tweeted my commitment and my progress so far. <br /><br />There's also a pinned tweet that provides a high-level overview of what happened which can be found here.<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Third time's the charm✨. Today I'm starting <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#100DaysOfCode</a>. I meant to tweet this thread initially around 5:30 AM EST before a wink of sleep. This bout of insomnia introduces some concerns/trepidation wrt what the outcome will be.</div>— Dale Vivian Ross (@dalevross) <a href="https://twitter.com/dalevross/status/1192183717269266432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2019</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> <br />So I'm getting up again. Wish me luck!  <br />Even better, join me on <a href="http://freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a> and learn to code. I'll help!
