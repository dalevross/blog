I'm in pain. It's not the worst, and I was still able to work out at the [UFC Gym in Springfield][ufcgym]. My worst pain was in 2017 when I could barely move. Buttoning my shirt was almost impossible. Showering, Ai Caramba.

What saved me then was a Groupon deal.

[Dr Vetere][vetere] was amazing. Had I remained in the Bronx, I would possibly still be going there for a fix-up. When I mentioned I was a software engineer he suggested I write a generic website/app for chiropractors that could be potentially sold (never happened).

After the session at UFC Gym's, I  spoke with trainer Sydney about my goals but mentioned that I'm currently seeing a new chiropractor. I almost went for another Groupon deal (It's MY money, let me be cheap), but a friend recommended his own chiropractor
[Family Chiropractic Wellness][fcw]. This Friday is my 3rd appointment. The serendipity surrounding my arrival time for the first visit was cool. Those who know me understand.

I love these pyrocrackters (That cracking ish they do is fire). My very first experience was with a chiropractor was [Dr Dominick D'anna][danna] of [Be Simply Well][bsw]. He mentioned the connection between one's physical state and their state of mind. I also explored a couple of other chiropractors before I left Orlando for the last time. I met them at an expo I attended. What I do like is that all these doctors are at the very least aware of the existence of a source greater than themselves.

As I type this there is a pinch that will probably get sorted out at the next appointment, but I'm committed to pushing my body to where I desire it to be.

So I protec, with chiropractic care

And I attac, with [luvcityfitness][lcf] and UFC Gym Springfield.

This post was inspired by the pinch in my back. Forgive the title, I'm weird like that.

A few are still in the drafts and I hope to start churning them out more often.

Today is the anniversary of the day I entered the United States of America, full time. A lot has changed but a lot remains the same.
