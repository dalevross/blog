**A**dmittedly I missed it all this time

**L**ife went along with my greatest crime

**S**earching outside for how to be true

**E**ach day I now see it has always been you

**I**f only I’d let you in on my outrageous goals

**T**ruth is you’d remind me it’s all about souls

**A**h, an extra A is evidently here, first as the last even with you my dear.

**A**ffording things these days may be hard

**G**ames have been played but you hold the top card

**A** lady once told me, she’d love me forever

**T**ruth is she loved you, she now says not ever

**H**ow do I get back to the me you once knew?

**A**djust my mindset and ask, “What would mom do?”

**R**ow on my dear, this long river is yours

**O**ut of bondage you brought me, with balanced oars

**S**omehow we still made it despite le resistance.

**S**hake a leg my dear, you have mastered this dance.

Alseita Ross, thank you for everything you given and not asking for a thing in return. I know of no other deserving gratitude for keeping me sane when all hell broke loose. I needed to look with your eyes and convert the pain to love.
