I call myself a polyglot, which in programming terms means one
who is able to proficiently code in more than one programming language.
While my proficiency has waned due to lack of use in some languages, I have
over the years written code in C, C++, Java, Scheme, C#, VB6, VB.NET, PHP and Python. I even did a bit of Assembly and Prolog at university.
<br/>
While I have some spare time, I am deciding to take up a task that, while somewhat unproductive, should be fun and somewhat useful for confidence re-building. I am going attempt to write a simple program daily by choosing a language for each letter of the alphabet. I will be using [this wikipedia article][wiki] as a source. Wish me luck!
