Over the years, I've used twitter in a way it was possibly not meant to be used. I didn't really dwell on my follower count too much. I however had/have an insatiable desire to know all the things, almost to an omniscient level. So I followed a looot of people to keep my finger on the pulse of the world. If twitter suggested it, I obliged.

This is frowned upon in some circles however, but honey badger don't... I actually saw a tweet from someone *achoo*@levelsio*achoo*,about writing a script to auto-block people with a wonky ratio. While typing this up I decided to run a search and found another one of Pieter's creations. Smart fellow, but I probably met the mute list thanks to 2017. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Okay so I made it:<br><br>âœ¨ Blunble Bot âœ¨<br><br>&quot;Blunble&quot; is Korean slang for BLock UNBLock. If you block and unblock someone on Twitter, they stop following you. It&#39;s a polite way of getting rid of trolls. This bot does that to whoever you mute.<a href="https://t.co/s8w6VBTgNi">https://t.co/s8w6VBTgNi</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/naval?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@naval</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@balajis</a> <a href="https://t.co/9jz9I0ZTZA">pic.twitter.com/9jz9I0ZTZA</a></p>&mdash; Øœ (@levelsio) <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1145691748913430528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Anyhoo, I saw a tweet from Anil Dash and my eyes lit up. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey, for folks who&#39;ve noticed â€” I&#39;m unfollowing everybody again as part of a fresh start for the new year. Please don&#39;t be hurt, it doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t love you or want to hear from you! Just a reset, and feel free to DM me if needed. More on unfollowing: <a href="https://t.co/dAudGTAdQ3">https://t.co/dAudGTAdQ3</a></p>&mdash; Anil Dash ðŸ¥­ (@anildash) <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/1211144189032972289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I've been meaning to figure out twitter automation to run some analysis according to my own parameters but it just never happened.

Thanks to Anil, I now have a base to start from which should reduce the effort required. He also mentioned a [Glitch App][glitch-app] that I might just remix for the grand designs I have in mind.



For now I've hit my limit so here are my [current 5000][c5000] that I'll have to trim until my
