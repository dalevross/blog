The following was dictated by John Howe a fellow patient at a recent hospital visit.
John gave me permission to share this with or without attribution though he did say he'd
potentially be crucified again, whatever that means. John appeared extremely smart being fairly fluent in German (offering to teach me for a price), and also completing a Sudoku puzzle from a newspaper in a fairly short window of time.

**How can we construct truth?**

First we must discuss what truth is. Ultimately truth should be unchangeable. That means everything can be characterized as "TRUE or NOT TRUE". In a democracy people are constitutionally guaranteed respect for their own stupid opinions. Good and bad are determined
by the unification of enough stupid opinions qualified to determine any issue.


Paul the apostle to the Gentiles divided everything, Alles in creation as S and not S<sup>1</sup>. Paul assures every Christian that we as Christians struggle not against flesh and blood but against
powers and principalities and wickedness in high places. Satan, the enemy of every man's soul prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour as the father of lies, deceit and hatefulness. Satan appeals to the vulnerability of man to be wicked, jealous, envious, covetous, murderous, conceited and stupid. QED.

**What is truth**

Man can recognize his sinful nature and pray to God for change and his salvation from his wickedness according to God's plan for redemption. Basically one needs to learn about Jesus Christ.

GOD BLESS

<sup>1</sup> John clarified that this means Seen and Not Seen
