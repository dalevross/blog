I was born and raised in Clarendon, Jamaica. In 2005, I graduated from University of the West Indies, Mona with a B. Sc. (Hons) in Computer Science and Electronics. I then started my professional career as a software engineer and have not looked back since. Spanning activities across the Software Development Life Cycle, I am what would be considered a full stack developer, performing duties in front-end, middle-tier and back-end systems. Though I am proficient in multiple languages, I am primarily a .NET Developer with skills including C#, ASP.NET, MSSQL, SSIS and SSRS, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Outside of work,I use my skills to solve various problems using PHP, Python and Node.js, but will find the right tool for the job when necessary. Outside of writing software, I use multiple online learning resources to boost my skills. 

I was diagnosed bipolar in 2014 though I experienced mania unknowingly since the summer of '2013. I could identify the difference I just didn't know what it was at the time. So now I'm trying to rebuild what was lost due to the effects of a mental illness.
